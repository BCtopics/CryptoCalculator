Crypto Initial Persona's/feedback


Persona's -

1. A Boy/Girl age 18-25 who is interested in seeing how much a certain crypto currency is worth.

^^ General Persona's

2. Bob is a college kid who bought 250 Ethereum back during the crowdsale. He paid $0.25 for each one and would like to know how much they are worth now. He can open the calculator, enter 250, and see how much they are worth at the current market price.

^^ More specific Persona's


Initial view idea -

Have a view a textfield where they can enter an amount of currency. Then they can hit the button corresponding to whichever currency they'd like to check, an alert will pop up with the total.

Colors - Purple with a light gray background.

- Questions

1. Alert controller or a textLabel? Or perhaps a different view all together?

2. How many different types should they be able to check? should it be limited to 6 or 9 of the most popular ones?

3. Should I have the user tap one of the icons first, and then a alert controller pop up where you enter the amount? Or should I keep it the way it is (textfield) on initial view.

4. Bigger/Smaller icons? Why?

5. Should I have the currency name on the icon, just the logo itself, or just the name? Why?



- Other ideas

What if I had the total at the top and just start at $0.00 when they hit the button the total starts to change over time to the correct amount, through some sort of animation. Kind of like the old time cash registers, or a slot machine style.

Potentially add feature that could calculate the amount made after ROI. For example if you paid $1, and sold for $2 you'd have made $1.
